# Human_Service
This is the project for our team we did for our Senior Project class. The objective of the class was to allow students to familarize themselves with working in a team enviornment and use all of the knowledge we learned throughout our major coursework, while giving them a real world project to undertake.

Our team went with the Human Serivces Field Experience System Project. We picked this project mostly because it interested us the most, as well as challenge us to put the knowledge we had learned to use to create a interesting and useful project. The goal of this project is to help manage students timesheets work flow, and generate and view reports based on students timesheets. create long term storage of data, monitor a dashboard, and report them all.
