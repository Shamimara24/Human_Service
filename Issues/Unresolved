This file contains a list of all of the issues that remain to be addressed from the mid assessment demo:
1) Set up automatic emails
        • Notification of approve or rejected timesheet
        • Notification of < 60 hours through semester (for example)
        • Notification of being close to 120 hour maximum 


The additional enhancements we would like to implmented from the the mid assesment demo:
1) Student Dashboard Page
        • Possible colored key for easy visual appeal of thresholds
                 • Red - extremely close to 120 hour maximum
                 • Yellow - mildly close to 120 hour maximum
2) Administrator Dashboard Page
        • Possible colored key for easy visual appeal of thresholds
                 • Red - extremely close to 120 hour maximum
                 • Yellow - mildly close to 120 hour maximum
