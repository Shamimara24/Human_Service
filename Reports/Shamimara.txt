Professor Baliga,

Started from the beginning I participated to the required docs regarding the project.
Figured that php mail library can be used to make automated email working when it was decided to start research stuffs.
Helped organize some pages- activation, login, register.
Made the register page separate than the login page so that new user first creates account only in register page.
Decided to have forget password working and got it working by the help of Brandon, users are allowed to create new password securely.
Attended all the meetings that the group decided to have.
As I didn’t take the Database course, I wasn’t very helpful to the group in this part but stayed active as long the semester went.

Thank you.
