Project Contributions:

1) Login/Register page: I coded everything found in the files found for login.php and register.php

2.) Timesheet system: I implemented the HTML that Sri created for the timehseet form, and coded all the PHP that makes
	the timesheet saving/submitting system work.
	
3.) Admin reporting: I ooded everything found in adminreporting.php except for the initial drop down list that lists the
	students' names. This includes the PHP that makes accepting/rejecting timesheets.
	
4.) Database: I basically managed/configured the whole database myself. I also created most, if not all, the queries that exist
	in the PHP within our project files.
	
5.) Forgot/Reset Password: The functionality that exists for a user to reset a password thru the login page or thru his or her
	profile page was created by me. It is worth noting that Shamimara did try her hand at the forgot password system, but it did 
	not end up fitting well into the current state of our program, so I took the liberty to re-code it to make implementation smoother.
